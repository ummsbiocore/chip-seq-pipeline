ChIP-seq Pipeline maps reads with Bowtie2, removes duplicates with Picard or Samtools, calls ChIP peaks with MACS2 and finally creates count table for analysis.  

#### Steps:
  1. For Quality Control, we use FastQC to create qc outputs. There are optional read quality filtering (trimmomatic), read quality trimming (trimmomatic), adapter removal (cutadapt) processes available.
  2. In the sequential mapping step, Bowtie2 is used to count or filter out common reads (eg. ercc, rmsk). 
  3. Bowtie2 is used to align reads to a selected genome, and duplicates removed with Picard or Samtools,
  4. When processing several samples together, pipeline provide consensus peak calls by merging all peaks individually called in each samples using Bedtools (Quinlan and Hall 2010). The number of reads in each peak location are then quantified using Bedtools (Quinlan and Hall 2010) coverage function.
  5. Optionally, genome-wide Bam analysis is done by RseQC.
  6. Optionally, you can create Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)  and Genome Browser Files (TDF and Bigwig, respectively)
  7. As a result, pipeline generates a matrix that has the count values for each peak region and samples. This matrix can be uploaded directly to the embedded version of DEBrowser (Kucukural et al. 2019) to perform differential analysis or downloaded to perform other analysis.

#### Inputs:

  - `Reads`
  - `ChIP-prep section`: To enable peak calling, please click settings of `run_ChIP_MACS2` and enter your samples in the `Sample Definitions` section by right click and choosing <b>Insert reads Dataset Files</b> option as described below:
	
	There are three fields need to be entered for each sample: output-prefix, sample-prefix, and input-prefix. 

	| Output-Prefix | Sample-Prefix | Input-Prefix (optional) |
	|---------------|---------------|-------------------------|
	| exper-rep1    |  exper-rep1   |                         |
	| control-rep1  |  control-rep1 |                         |

	* Output-Prefix: Output prefix of the sample. Final reports will be created by using this sample name. 
	* Sample-Prefix: Sample name which is entered in the reads section.
	* Input-Prefix (optional):  If your experiment has background sample (input), you can specify its prefix in this section.
